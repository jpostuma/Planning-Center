# My Planning Center Workflow
Files I use in my PCO Workflow for the use of sharing with others in the community.

## People
### Custom Reports Plus
This PCO People report is customizeable and easy to use. It provides a simple list of people with a range of different details about them. This report utilizes Bootstrap 3 and jQuery to provide style and functionality.
Key features:
###### Include and exlude available details about people
###### Print-friendly
--* You can print directly from the web browser or save as a PDF if your computer has a 'Print to PDF' option.
###### SAVEABLE
--* After the page is loaded, all liquid markup is replaced with content. This means that all the information about each person is saved to that specific HTML file and that the report can be edited locally. This is useful for printing different variations of the same list.

Please fill free to pull this and poke at it yourself. I am only an intermediate coder and a COMPLETE novice at Git and GitHub, so I am sure there are more effecient methods of doing things I am not utilizing.
Enjoy this report, and I hope that it blesses you and your ministry!
